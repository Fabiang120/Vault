## Notes:
1. Install react-router-dom
    - cd vault
    - npm install react-router-dom
    - If you're getting errors, try: npm install react@latest react-dom@latest

    - react-router-dom is used to establish routing between pages in React, for instance this is how you can get the login form  to display when doing /login, and register when doing /register.
