## Project Workflow Guide

This document outlines the workflow process for contributing to this project. Please follow these steps to ensure smooth collaboration and code integration.

### 1. Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, use an existing branch or create one from the `main` branch.

### 2. Sync with Main
Before starting any work, always pull the latest changes from main to ensure your branch is up to date and avoid merge conflicts later.
1.  git checkout main
2. git pull origin main
3. checkout your-branch-name
4. merge main

### 3. Make your Changes
Once your branch is up to date, make the necessary changes. Be sure to test your code thoroughly to ensure it runs as expected.

### 4. Commit and Push Changes
After making and testing your changes, commit them with a meaningful message and push them to your remote branch.

### 5. Open a Pull Request
Once your changes are pushed, open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main branch. Ensure the PR description clearly explains the changes and includes any relevant details.

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button for your branch.
3. Review the changes and resolve any merge conflicts if they exist.
4. Submit the pull request.
